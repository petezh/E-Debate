# E-Debate Entries Analysis
#### About

The project analyzed trends in debate tournament entries from 2019 and 2020. All data for the project are available in the `datasets` folder. The `entries.csv` contains scraped entries pages from 37 tournaments. Please reach out to me for interest in the scraper.

The `actscores.csv` dataset is sourced from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/305987/us-average-act-scores-by-state/). The `income.csv`  data is taken from the [St. Louis fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N). The `locations.csv` dataset is sourced from [Google](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv).

Most of the analysis was conducted in the `analysis.ipynb` Notebook. Some analyses were done from the `EDA.xlsx` Excel file. The significance tests were conducted with the `stats.R` script.
